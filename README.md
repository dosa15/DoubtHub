# DoubtHub
The main goal of our small start-up, which we call “DoubtHub”, is to provide a reliable education portal on the internet, where students pursuing any engineering degree can fall back on. From this website, they would always have a way to learn various concepts, techniques and applications of the same by consulting the teachers who use the platform.
